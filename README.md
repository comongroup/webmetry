# webmetry alpha
## TODO

* proper configuration override (having the breakpoints working deltas, for instance, not the entire thing at once)
* base/hang lines segregation (independent toggles for design grid and lines)
* update grid at resize (render grid is way too absolute right now)
* better solution for needed styles (hard to mantain)
* it would be nice to inject the grid at some element
* some code beautification and optimization (yeah)
